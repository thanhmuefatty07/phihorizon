## ?? What Makes PhiHorizon Unique?

PhiHorizon is the **world's first** trading framework that integrates:

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** | Phi (F) metrics measure market "consciousness" |
| **XGBoost ML** | Gradient boosting for direction prediction |
| **Walk-Forward Optimization** | Robust backtesting with 696+ validation windows |
| **Consciousness Filter** | Trade only when market shows integrated patterns |

> ?? **Research-backed:** All claims validated with academic benchmarks. No overclaiming.

---

## ?? Honest Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Academic Benchmark |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Accuracy | 55-60% | 54-65% typical for crypto |
| WF Sharpe | 1.62 | >0.5 is good |
| WF Windows | 696 | High coverage |
| Phi Range | 0.3-0.7 | Market state indicator |

> ?? **Disclaimer:** Past performance ? future results. This is a research framework, not financial advice.

## ?? The Phi Advantage

**Phi (F)** measures how "integrated" market information is:

- **High F (>0.5)**: Market shows coherent patterns ? Good for trading
- **Low F (<0.3)**: Market is chaotic/random ? Avoid trading

```python
from src.consciousness import PhiCalculator

phi_calc = PhiCalculator()
phi = phi_calc.calculate_phi(market_data)

if phi > 0.5:
    # Market is "conscious" - execute trade
    strategy.execute()
```
